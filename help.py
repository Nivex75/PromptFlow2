        - Once inside, you'll see tabs specific to that project:
          - **Documents**: Upload and manage source documents
          - **Workflows**: Create and edit analysis workflows
          - **Results**: View all generated outputs
          - **Templates**: Browse available output templates

        ### 3. Upload Documents
        - In the Documents tab, click "‚ûï Upload New Document"

        ### What is a Project?
        A project is a dedicated workspace that contains:
        - **Documents**: The source files you want to analyze
        - **Workflows**: The analysis processes you've configured
        - **Results**: All outputs generated from running workflows
        - **Templates**: Output format templates (shared globally)

        ### Project Benefits
        - **Isolation**: Each project's data is separate
        - **Organization**: Group related documents and workflows
        - **Efficiency**: Batch process entire projects at once
        - **Clarity**: Clear visual indication of which project you're in

        ### Project Navigation
        - The project header shows you're inside a project workspace
        - Use "‚Üê Exit Project" to return to project selection
        - All tabs and actions apply only to the current project

        ### The Power Button
        When your project has both documents and workflows, a special button appears:
        **"‚ö° Run Workflows and Generate Results"**

        ### What It Does
        1. Takes each document in your project
        2. Runs every workflow against each document
        3. Generates results using the assigned templates
        4. Saves all outputs to the Results tab
        5. Shows progress with a real-time progress bar

        ### When to Use It
        - Processing multiple contracts with the same analysis
        - Running comprehensive document reviews
        - Generating reports for multiple files at once
        - Updating all analyses after workflow changes

        ### Tips
        - Ensure each workflow has a template assigned
        - Check that template markers match workflow prompts
        - Monitor the progress bar and error messages
        - Review results in the Results tab after completion

        ### Creating Workflows
        1. Inside a project, go to the Workflows tab
        2. Click "‚ûï Create New Workflow"
        3. Add prompts in sequence
        4. Assign an output template
        5. Test with sample documents

        ### Workflow Components
        - **Prompts**: Individual analysis tasks
        - **Sequence**: Order matters - each prompt builds on previous results
        - **Template**: Defines how results are formatted
        - **Status**: Draft or Completed

        ### Testing Workflows
        - Use the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button to modify prompts
        - Test individual prompts before running full workflow
        - Compare original vs edited prompt results
        - Save successful changes

        ### Running Individual Workflows
        - Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run" on any workflow
        - Select a document and template
        - Execute to see immediate results

        ### Understanding Templates
        Templates are document formats that get filled with workflow results.

        ### Marker System
        - Templates contain markers like `{PROMPT_NAME_OUTPUT}`
        - Markers are automatically replaced with prompt results
        - Example: `{RENT_OUTPUT}` ‚Üí actual rent amount from analysis

        ### Creating Effective Templates
        1. Use clear, descriptive marker names
        2. Match markers exactly to prompt names
        3. Format: `{PROMPT NAME_OUTPUT}` (spaces become underscores)
        4. Test with sample data first

        ### Template Types
        - **Letter Templates**: For client communications
        - **Report Templates**: For detailed analysis
        - **Summary Templates**: For executive overviews
