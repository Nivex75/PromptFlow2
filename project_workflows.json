Step 2: If the lease is of a whole building then a) find the address of the premises b) identify if the lease refers to a plan and c) see if you can find a Land Registry title number for the the premises. Step 3: If the lease is of part of a larger building or property then you need to a) find the address of the larger building or property, b) see if you can find a Land Registry title number for the building or premises c) identify whether the presmises are defined by reference to a plan d) see if the lease contains a more detailed definition of the premises and highlight key details from this to include in your summary e) If the lease is of part of the building then the Tenant will be responsible for making a contribution to the cost of repair and maintenance to the rest of the building, via the service charge' Step 4: Once you have completed these steps then provide a short crisp description of the Premises which includes the full address.
